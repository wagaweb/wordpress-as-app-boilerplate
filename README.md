# Wordpress "As App" Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate we use internally to develop enterprise-scale applications with Wordpress.

The readme is still under construction.

## Usage
- Download the repo files (don't clone)
- Put the files where you want
- Edit those files with your settings:
	- configs/**
	- gulpfile.js
	- wp-content/themes/your-theme/*
	- wp-content/plugins/your-plugin/*
- Edit "your-theme" and "your-plugin" directories to meet your needs.
- Install dependencies with composer and npm
- Run "gulp".

The theme is inspired by [_strap](https://github.com/ptbello/_strap) with bootstrap-sass instead of less. It's a bare-bone not fully functional theme, so you have to implement the theme yourself.
